          <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-0">My biggest strength is that I can think on my feet and can work
            under a lot of pressure. As an event manager at Sarah’s
            boutique, we were organizing an IT conference that needed a number of last-minute changes - due to a speaker
            canceling
            because of an emergency and 2 of our volunteers not being able to show up.
            So, we allocated more time to each speaker and added a QA section at the end of each speech. We also
            encouraged the
            present speakers to talk about their business and personal experience more in-depth after they were done
            with their
            speech.
            As for being understaffed, one day before the conference, I reached out to my network and found 2 students
            who were
            willing to help out. I personally met them 2 hours before the conference and got them up to speed with
            everything we
            were doing for the day, and gave them their tasks.
