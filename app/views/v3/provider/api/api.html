        Integrating with our Recruitment API may be useful if you want to create adverts using your existing systems. It will allow you to publish to <a href="https://www.findapprenticeship.service.gov.uk/apprenticeshipsearch" class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state">Find an apprenticeship</a>.
        <br><br>
        The Display adverts API allows you to display adverts from Find an Apprenticeship on any website.
      </p>-->
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What does an API do?</h2> 
      <p class="govuk-body">
        APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) let applications share information and data with each other.
        <br><br>
        If you connect using the Recruitment API, you can use your own systems to publish to <a href="https://www.findapprenticeship.service.gov.uk/apprenticeshipsearch" class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state">Find an apprenticeship</a>. 
        <br><br>
        You can also use the Display adverts API to retrieve vacancies from Find an Apprenticeship and display on your websites.
      </p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How do I use the API?</h2> 
      <div class="govuk-inset-text">
        You'll need someone with technical knowledge to connect your system with the API, for example a software developer.
      </div>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        You can share the <a href="../../guidance/get-started" class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state">developer get started page</a> with the person who is going to connect your system with the API, they can access the API from there.             
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        It can take a while to connect using an API, so leave enough time to integrate it.
      </p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How do I access the API?</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        If you have owner permissions you can access the <a href="api-list" class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state">API keys</a>. 
        <br><br>
        Your developer will be able to try out the API using the sandbox provided.
        <br><br>
        You will need to <a href="api-list" class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state">provide your developer with a key</a> and <a href="../../guidance/get-started" class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state"> the developer get started page</a> so they can use the APIs.
