    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What do our APIs do?</h2> 
    <p class="govuk-body">
      APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) let applications share information and data with each other.
      <br><br>
      We have two APIs you can use:
    </p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li><strong>Recruitment API</strong> &ndash; our Recruitment API allows you to create vacancies on Find an apprenticeship using your own systems.</li>
      <li><strong>Display adverts API</strong> &ndash; our Display adverts API allows you to display vacancies from Find an apprenticeship on your own websites.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How do I use the APIs?</h2> 
    <div class="govuk-inset-text">
      You'll need someone with technical knowledge to connect your system with the API, for example a software developer.
    </div>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      You can share this <a href="../../guidance/get-started" class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state">developer get started page</a> with the person who is going to connect your system with the API, they can access the API from there.             
      <br><br>
      You will need to give your developer API keys. The keys give your developer permission to connect to the API on your behalf.
      <br><br>
      Your developer will be also able to try out the API using the sandbox provided.
    </p>
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How do I access the API Key?</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      If you have owner permissions you will be able to access the <a href="api-list" class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state">API keys</a>. 
    </p>
