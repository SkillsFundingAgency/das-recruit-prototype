      RESTful APIs.<br><br>
      Being RESTful, each record of information is assigned a globally unique URI, and the operations available on each resource are directly mapped to HTTP verbs. Data can be easily consumed by issuing simple GET requests on the required resource URI.<br><br>
      Read the Companies House REST API overview for more information about our API approach, REST web services and the JSON data format.

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">API authentication</h2>
      <p class=govuk-body">
        Access to API services requires authentication. Recruitment API requires <a href="#" class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state">API authentication</a> credentials to be sent with each request, which is sent as an API key, stream key or OAuth access token.<br><br>
