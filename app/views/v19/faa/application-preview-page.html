      canceling because of an emergency and 2 of our volunteers not being able to show up.
      So, we allocated more time to each speaker and added a QA section at the end of each speech. We also
      encouraged the present speakers to talk about their business and personal experience more in-depth after they
      were done
      with their speech. As for being understaffed, one day before the conference, I reached out to my network and
      found 2 students
      who were willing to help out. I personally met them 2 hours before the conference and got them up to speed
      with
